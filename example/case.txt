From the information provided, it's clear that Paul Walker was a part of the "Fast and Furious" series, but the specific list of cars is not mentioned. Since I lack this particular detail, I will call a search engine to get the specific list of cars Paul Walker drove in the "Fast and Furious" movies.

Based on the updated information, it seems the focus was on his career, financials, and family. However, I am still missing the specific list of cars he drove in the "Fast and Furious" movies. Since it appears that the information might not be contained within the accessed documents, and I have no further search queries to make, I will provide an answer based on the details I have.

<think> I remember that the heart's electrical impulses originate from a specific part of the heart, but I need to confirm which part.</think>
<search> origin of heart's electrical impulses </search>

<information>Doc 1(Title: "Cardiac pacemaker") Cardiac pacemaker The contraction of cardiac muscle (heart muscle) in all animals is initiated by electrical impulses known as action potentials. The rate at which these impulses fire controls the rate of cardiac contraction, that is, the heart rate. The cells that create these rhythmic impulses, setting the pace for blood pumping, are called pacemaker cells, and they directly control the heart rate. They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a
Doc 2(Title: "Electrical conduction system of the heart") Electrical conduction system of the heart The electrical conduction system of the heart transmits signals generated usually by the sinoatrial node to cause contraction of the heart muscle. The pacemaking signal generated in the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium to the atrioventricular node, along the Bundle of His and through bundle branches to cause contraction of the heart muscle. This signal stimulates contraction first of the right and left atrium, and then the right and left ventricles. This process allows blood to be pumped throughout the body. The conduction system consists of specialised heart muscle cells, and is
Doc 3(Title: "Sinoatrial node") Sinoatrial node The sinoatrial node (SA node), also known as sinus node, is a group of cells located in the wall of the right atrium of the heart. These cells have the ability to spontaneously produce an electrical impulse (action potential; see below for more details), that travels through the heart via the electrical conduction system (see figure 1) causing it to contract. In a healthy heart, the SA node continuously produces action potential, setting the rhythm of the heart and so is known as the heart's natural pacemaker. The rate of action potential production (and therefore the heart rate)</information>

From the information provided, it is clear that the heart's electrical impulses are generated in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is often referred to as the heart's natural pacemaker. </think>
